# Runtime CLI Reference

Every conda-ship artifact includes a generated runtime. In this page,
`RUNTIME` stands for the runtime name resolved by `cs build` from
`[tool.conda-ship].runtime` or `--runtime`. `DELEGATE` stands for the
executable inside the managed prefix that receives pass-through arguments.

For conda-express, `RUNTIME` is `cx`. For an embedded conda-express artifact,
the staged runtime is `cxz`.

## Global Options

`-v, --verbose`
: Increase output detail.

`-q, --quiet`
: Suppress non-essential output.

`--path PATH`
: Use a custom install path instead of the distribution default. This applies to
  `bootstrap`, `status`, `shell`, `uninstall`, and pass-through delegate commands.
  Put it before pass-through commands so conda does not interpret it as one of
  its own options, for example `RUNTIME --path /tmp/demo install numpy`.

`-h, --help`
: Show runtime help.

`-V, --version`
: Show the runtime version.

## `RUNTIME bootstrap`

Install conda into the runtime's install path.

```bash
RUNTIME bootstrap [OPTIONS]
```

Options:

`--force`
: Remove an existing install path before bootstrapping again.

`--install-scheme SCHEME`
: Install with a named install scheme instead of the stamped default. Currently
  supported: `conda-home`, which installs below `~/.conda/INSTALL_NAME`, and
  `user-data`, which installs below the platform user data directory. This is
  mutually exclusive with the global `--path` option.

`--lockfile PATH`
: Use an external rattler-lock file instead of the stamped runtime lock.

`--bundle DIR`
: Pre-populate the package cache from a directory containing `.conda` or
  `.tar.bz2` archives. The directory is treated as a flat package archive
  bundle, not as a conda channel mirror.

`--offline`
: Disable network access. Packages must be available from the local cache, an
  explicit `--bundle`, or an embedded bundle.

Examples:

```bash
# Standard network bootstrap from the stamped lockfile
RUNTIME bootstrap

# Re-bootstrap into the default install path
RUNTIME bootstrap --force

# Bootstrap into a custom install path
RUNTIME --path /opt/name bootstrap

# Bootstrap from an external bundle directory
RUNTIME bootstrap --bundle ./packages --offline
```

For an embedded runtime, conda-ship detects the built-in bundle
automatically:

```bash
RUNTIMEz bootstrap
```

An explicit `--bundle` still takes priority over the embedded bundle.
Embedded bundle extraction rejects anything except top-level `.conda` and
`.tar.bz2` package archive files.

## `RUNTIME status`

Show runtime and install details.

```bash
RUNTIME [--path PATH] status [--install-scheme SCHEME]
```

The output includes the runtime name, runtime version, install path, configured
channels, configured package specs, installed package count, and conda
executable path for the managed prefix.

## `RUNTIME shell`

Start a conda-spawn subshell for an environment.

```bash
RUNTIME shell [ENV]
```

Examples:

```bash
RUNTIME shell myenv
exit
```

This command delegates to `conda spawn`. It uses the runtime's default install
path.

## `RUNTIME uninstall`

Remove the install path and named environments.

```bash
RUNTIME uninstall [OPTIONS]
```

Options:

`--install-scheme SCHEME`
: Remove the install path for a named install scheme instead of the stamped default.
  Currently supported: `conda-home` and `user-data`. This is mutually exclusive with the
  global `--path` option.

`-y, --yes`
: Skip the interactive confirmation prompt.

The command removes the install path, attempts to remove named environments
cleanly, and prints a hint for removing the runtime through the package manager
or install method that provided it.

## `RUNTIME help`

Show the runtime help text.

```bash
RUNTIME help
```

## Pass-Through Commands

Any command not listed above is passed through to the configured delegate
executable after bootstrap. For a runtime whose delegate is `conda`, this looks
like:

```bash
RUNTIME create -n myenv python=3.12 numpy
RUNTIME install -n myenv pandas
RUNTIME list -n myenv
RUNTIME env list
RUNTIME info

# Use a custom runtime install path for pass-through commands
RUNTIME --path /tmp/name install -n myenv pandas
```

If the install path does not exist, pass-through commands automatically
bootstrap first.

The delegate process receives a conda-like base environment: `CONDA_ROOT_PREFIX`,
`CONDA_PREFIX`, `CONDA_DEFAULT_ENV=base`, `CONDA_SHLVL=1`, and a `PATH` with the
managed prefix's executable directories first. On Unix this includes `bin` and
`condabin`; on Windows this includes the root prefix, `Library` binary
directories, `Scripts`, `bin`, and `condabin`.

## Disabled Shell Commands

Generated runtimes use conda-spawn for activation. When the delegate is
`conda`, these commands are intercepted with runtime-specific guidance instead
of being passed through:

- `RUNTIME activate`
- `RUNTIME deactivate`
- `RUNTIME init`

Use `RUNTIME shell ENV` instead of `conda activate ENV`.
