# `conda ship` Reference

Most users run conda-ship as `cs`.

When `conda-ship` is installed in a conda environment, it can also add a
`conda ship` command. This is only a conda-style shortcut for the same
builder:

```bash
conda ship inspect
conda ship build
```

`conda ship ...` runs the installed `cs` executable with the same
arguments. It is not a separate builder and it does not make conda-ship part
of conda itself.

Packaged builds find the runtime template installed next to `cs`
automatically. Source checkouts need an installed template, a
`CONDA_SHIP_TEMPLATE` environment variable, or an explicit `--template` path.

## Packaging Details

`conda-ship` first looks for a `cs` executable next to the current Python
interpreter, then falls back to `PATH`.

A conda package must install both pieces into the same environment:

- the Rust-built `cs` executable
- the Python `conda_ship` adapter package

For custom packaging or tests, set `CONDA_SHIP_EXECUTABLE` to an explicit
executable path.

## Argument Forwarding

Arguments after `conda ship` are passed to `cs`:

```bash
conda ship build --layout embedded
```

When you need to pass an argument that conda's own parser would consume, insert
`--` before the conda-ship arguments:

```bash
conda ship -- --help
```

Running `conda ship` without arguments shows `cs --help`.
