# conda-ship

Build ready-to-run conda runtimes.

`conda-ship` is a generic builder for single-binary conda runtimes. It
installs the `cs` CLI, but it does not ship a first-party distribution.
Downstream projects choose the runtime name, delegate executable, package set,
channels, documentation URL, and release channel.

`conda-express` is one downstream distribution: it uses conda-ship to build the
official `cx` and `cxz` runtimes. conda-ship owns the reusable builder;
conda-express owns the product defaults and release channels for `cx`.

## Start Here

If you are new to conda-ship, build the tutorial runtime first. It starts from
a small conda workspace and gives you a working mental model for locks,
artifacts, and the generated runtime:

```bash
conda create -n cs-demo -c conda-forge conda-ship conda-workspaces
conda activate cs-demo
cs --version
```

Then use the documentation by the kind of help you need.
