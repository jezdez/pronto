# Project Boundaries

conda-ship builds ready-to-run conda runtimes. It is not itself a conda
distribution.

The split from conda-express puts the generic pieces here and leaves
distribution policy in downstream projects.

## What conda-ship Owns

conda-ship owns the reusable build and runtime machinery:

- deriving a runtime lock from a conda or Pixi source lockfile
- pruning excluded packages and exclusive dependencies after the solve
- downloading package archives into compressed bundles
- copying the generic runtime template and stamping distribution data
- staging `online`, `external`, and `embedded` artifact layouts
- writing artifact metadata: `.runtime.lock`, `.packages.txt`, `.info.json`,
  and `.sha256`
- exposing the composite GitHub Action and local builder CLI

The generated runtime behavior also lives here: `bootstrap`, `status`, `shell`,
`uninstall`, pass-through to the configured delegate, offline bundle handling, embedded bundle
handling, and conda-spawn based activation.

## What Downstream Distributions Own

Downstream projects decide what their users get:

- runtime names and delegate executables
- package sets
- channels
- package exclusions
- default release channels
- documentation URLs
- Homebrew formulae
- Python or conda integration packages
- Docker images
- GitHub Release policy
- constructor-based installers or enterprise package manager recipes

conda-ship produces the runtimes and metadata those channels can distribute. It
does not decide whether every runtime includes the same conda plugins or uses
the same name.

## conda-express

{external+conda-express:doc}`conda-express <index>` is the downstream
distribution that publishes `cx` and `cxz`.

It owns the opinionated native conda package set, the `cx`/`cxz` runtime names,
Homebrew and shell-script installation, Docker images, Python or conda
distribution wrappers, and release policy for those artifacts.

When conda-express needs runtimes, its workflows call conda-ship from the
conda-express project root. The conda-express manifest names the `cx` runtime;
the `embedded` layout stages `cxz`. The package set remains conda-express
project input; conda-ship does not hard-code those choices. Its own scope page is
{external+conda-express:doc}`Project scope <scope>`.

## Relationship To Other Tools

conda-ship complements other conda ecosystem tools:

| Tool | Role |
| --- | --- |
| {external+conda-workspaces:doc}`conda-workspaces <index>` | Defines workspace manifests and lockfiles that conda-ship can consume |
| Pixi | Solves and records compatible source environments that conda-ship can consume |
| rattler-build | Builds conda packages |
| constructor | Builds OS installers |
| conda-ship | Builds runtimes that can be distributed directly or wrapped by other channels |
| {external+conda-express:doc}`conda-express <index>` | A conda-ship-based downstream distribution for `cx` and `cxz` |

conda-ship does not produce installer-generator output such as `.sh`, `.pkg`, or
`.msi`. Those formats can wrap conda-ship-built runtimes when a downstream
distribution needs them.

The {external+conda-express:doc}`conda-express docs <index>` are useful as a
concrete example of a downstream distribution. They describe `cx` and `cxz` as
products; conda-ship docs describe how to build and reason about products
like them.
